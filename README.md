# CSharpYieldReturn

    Explore some neat syntactic sugar in C#: "yield return" for enumerators

C# has a really neat feature for implementing enumerators: *yield return*.  This
reminds me of lazy list evaluation in Clojure.  It sure removes a lot of clutter!

This project was developed on Windows 10 with .NET Core. The initiaal version
of the *dotnet* utility I'm used was 1.0.0-preview2-003131. Later I upgraded
to dotnet 1.1.0.
